These pictures are for a new stand (New for 2014) that I have designed for the smaller Farmall tractors, like the Farmall CUB, CUB LoBoy, Farmall A, Farmall B, and Farmall C, series of tractors. These small tractors do not have a frame rail and the stand gets bolted to the oil pan rail of the engine. I'm calling the stand the "Mini-stand"  Each 4 inch wheel of the Mini stand contains a roller bearing making the tractor very easy to split.
