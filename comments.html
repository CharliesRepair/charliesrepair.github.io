                        Gary says splitting stands are fabricated very well, will last forever, and priced right. Used splitting stand and the TA handler on 1456 Farmall tractor and worked fine, transmission lined up and went back together very nicely.

                        The HD Splitting Stand arrived on Friday. They are a great looking stand. I split my JD 4650 on Sunday and the stand worked great. The tractor rolled together perfect with your stand.

                        We finished the installation of both Cub alternator kits and they both work just fine. The one with a magneto initially did not show oil pressure. It turned out that the oil pump needed to be primed after the rebuild. If we hadn't put on the alternator, we might have burnt up the motor before we noticed. Anyway, both kits work great. We did have to grind a little on the corners of the bracket near the fan built into the alternator. It just nicked the bracket when the engine ran. Thanks for your help and your prompt service.

                        I finished installing the 12 volt kit on my cub and it's working great! It sure is nice to go out and be able to fire it up without jumper cables and have bright lights when I need them!

                        Working with Charlie was a pleasure, I was more than pleased with my electrical conversion kit for my Farmall CUB. Charlie was friendly and very knowledgeable, nice to know there are still some places where you are not just a number. I highly recommend Charlieâ€™s Repair

                        We first met Charlie at Red Power Round-up in 2012 in DuQuoin, IL. My son was very intrigued with the idea of converting our Super W6 to a 12 volt system. The alternator mounted under the hood without any body work. In fact the idea was so great we bought another kit for the Farmall H and everything bolts right up, the little alternator charges immediately after starting, up to 14 volts just over idle. Thanks Charlie for the great idea.

                        Alternator conversion has went well with my Farmall H, your schematic is easy to read.
